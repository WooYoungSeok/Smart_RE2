       "'Answer the question using the information in the paragraph.\\n\\nFrance took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa, as well as South-East Asia, with other conquests in Central and East Africa, as well as the South Pacific. Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire. As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism. It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars.\\n\\nQuestion:  When did French Republicans back building the English empire?\\n\\nRead the paragraph again first. Then, provide the final answer in the format: \"Answer: XXX\", where XXX should be just a short phrase or word. If the question is unanswerable from the context, the final answer should be: \"Answer: N/A\".'"
