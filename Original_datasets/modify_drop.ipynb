       "'Answer the question using the information in the context.\\n\\nContext: Coming off their home win over the Browns, the Steelers flew to Sun Life Stadium for a Week 7 intraconference duel with the Miami Dolphins.  Pittsburgh trailed in the first quarter as Dolphins kicker Dan Carpenter made a 39-yard and a 23-yard field goal.  The Steelers took the lead in the second quarter with a 22-yard field goal from kicker Jeff Reed, followed by quarterback Ben Roethlisberger hooking up with wide receiver Hines Ward on a 21-yard touchdown pass.  Miami answered with Carpenter getting a 22-yard field goal, yet Pittsburgh came right back as Roethlisberger found wide receiver Mike Wallace on a 53-yard touchdown pass.  The Dolphins would close out the half with quarterback Chad Henne completing a 25-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Davone Bess. In the third quarter, the Steelers added onto their lead as Reed booted a 39-yard field goal.  Miami answered with Carpenter making a 37-yard field goal.  Miami retook the lead in the fourth quarter as Carpenter got a 40-yard field goal, yet Pittsburgh struck back as Reed got an 18-yard field goal.  The Dolphins tried to rally, but the Pittsburgh defense stiffened and held for the victory.\\n\\nQuestion: How many yards was the second longest touchdown pass?\\n\\nRead the previous content again first. Then, provide the final answer in the format: \"Answer: XXX\", where XXX should be just a short phrase or word.'"
